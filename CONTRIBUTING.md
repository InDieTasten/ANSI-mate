Contributing
============

Thank you for considering contributing to the project! This document outlines how you can contribute to the project and what you need to know before doing so.
Before contributing to the project, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

There are two main ways to contribute to the project:

1. By [reporting issues](#1-reporting-issues)
2. By [submitting pull requests](#2-submitting-pull-requests)

### 1. Reporting issues

If you find a bug, have a question, or have a feature request, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

Please provide as much relevant information as possible, especially for bug reports. This includes:
- The version of the project you are using
- The operation system you are using
- The terminal emulator you are using

### 2. Submitting pull requests

PRs should always be attached to an issue. If there is no issue for change you want to make, please open an issue first.

Once the issue is created, you can ask to be assigned to it. This will ensure, that the issue is being worked on and prevents others from also working on it.

Once you are assigned to the issue, you can start working on it. Create a fork of the repo and make changes towards the goal of the issue. Once you are done, create a pull request.

The commit messages should be clear and concise. They should start with a verb in the imperative mood, followed by a short description of the change. For example:

```
Add pencil tool to toolbar
```

The pull request should also contain a description of the changes made and reference the initial issue using one of GitHubs supported magic verbs (e.g. `closes`, `fixes`, `resolves`). For example:

```
This PR adds a pencil tool to the toolbar. It closes #123.
```

The PR will then be reviewed by the maintainers. If there are any issues, they will be discussed in the PR. Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
